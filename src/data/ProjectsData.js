    info: `As my inaugural solo project, I developed a web page aimed at streamlining the process of menu planning for a week. The objective was to provide users with a comprehensive solution encompassing recipe search, saving, and organization, along with the generation of a grocery list. During my research, I discovered the spoonacular API, a remarkable and robust resource that proved to be instrumental in achieving my goals. Its extensive capabilities and features allowed for a seamless integration of recipe management and culinary organization.`,

    info: `Less Sushi was a project that I embarked upon with a close friend of mine. Our ultimate mission was to put an end to the countless hours wasted pondering the eternal question: 'What do you want to eat?' We came up with a decision-making app that would save friendships and settle food disputes once and for all. Armed with the Yelp API, our ingenious creation allowed users to search for places that piqued their interest and add them to the pot of culinary contenders. But wait, there's more! When everyone was finished adding their suggestions, the real fun began. Each person had to pick their top three choices. Then, in a process as suspenseful as the World Cup finals, the votes were tallied, and behold, the victorious restaurant was crowned as the undeniable champion of our hungry souls. And guess what? We were legally bound to honor that victorious establishment and indulge in a meal fit for champions.`,

    info:`In our boot camp's final project, we were assigned the task of building a social media website from scratch. As a team of six, we divided the responsibilities and worked together to develop the front end, back end, and deploy the website using AWS EC2. This project not only boosted my technical skills but also taught me valuable lessons in effective teamwork and collaboration. I'm excited to apply these experiences and knowledge to my future projects with new teams.`,
